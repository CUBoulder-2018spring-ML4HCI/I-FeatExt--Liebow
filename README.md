# I-FeatExt--Liebow
Kadenze 5
Jake Liebow

A description of your goals: Control sound with facial movement.
Tools/libraries you used used: Wekinator & Wekinator Input Helper
What you accomplished: I can control the sound with the speed of my faces movement and its acceleration as opposed to positionally.
ML choices you made. Provide evaluation data (e.g. performance comparisons with other algorithms) showing why the ML algorithm and parameters you used were the right ones: I used a neural network because it seems to be the most accurate as far as directly mapping inputs to outputs.
